- Add checks for malloc.
- Aspiration window should probably return VALUE_NONE if interrupted.
- Try pgo (profile guided optimization).
- Profile code using gcov, operf and gprof.

VERY IMPORTANT
- Verify that the new transposition table works correctly.
- Verify that the new static exchange evaluation works correctly.

IDEAS
- Add an Elo option which works by randomly skipping moves in the
  search tree. The higher the ply the higher the chance of skipping.
  Should not skip anything at very low plies like 0 and 1 (depending
  on Elo).
