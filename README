bitbit
======
A bitboard based chess engine written in c.

Building bitbit
---------------
Run

	$ make

in the root directory. Make can be run with the following additional variables

	$ make TT={n} SIMD={simd} NNUE={file}

to specify a transposition table size, available SIMD instructions and an NNUE
filename respectively. TT={n} gives a transposition table of n MiB. The default
value of n is 256. The only available target for SIMD={simd} is avx2.

Training data
-------------
Every single binary file, evaluation constant and training data set that has
been used to tune bitbit, has been generated by programs from this repository
alone. No external programs nor files have been used as aid, with the exception
of Syzygy tablebases and the Syzygy probing tool Fathom, available at
<https://github.com/jdart1/Fathom>. The tournament manager cutechess-cli has
been used to run games between bitbit and itself. It is available at
<https://github.com/cutechess/cutechess>.

Testing
-------
bitbit is tested using the test server testbit. It is available at
<https://github.com/spinojara/testbit>.
